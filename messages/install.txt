DocBlockr Python
================

To get started:

1. Open a python file (syntax must be currently set to python)
2. Open a double quoted docstring (""") at one of the following places:
  - Top of the file
  - Beginning of a class
  - Beginning of a function
3. Press [enter] to trigger the autocomplete

If you don't want to trigger the parser on a docstring, simply hold down [ctrl]/[cmd] and press [enter]

For configuration and extendability, see the readme
